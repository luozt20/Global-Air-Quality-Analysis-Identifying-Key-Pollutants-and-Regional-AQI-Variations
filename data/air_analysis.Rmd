# Introduction

## Research Context

Recent years have witnessed the proliferation of evaluating the possible influencing factors of air quality, such as economy, geography and policy. For example, a study investigated the impact of quarantine measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic on air quality, with focusing on the Air Quality Index (AQI), PM2.5, and tropospheric NO2 levels (Benchrif et al. 2021).

However, research on the relationship between AQI indices seems to have not been addressed yet. In this study, based on available data, I conducted a preliminary analysis of the relationship between AQI categorical indices, sought possible patterns, and separately analyzed patterns for individual regions.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides a brief introduction to the research background and relevant data. Section 2 conducts Explorative Data Analysis. Section 3 focuses on model building and diagnostics. Section 4 presents a case study on India. And section 5 concludes and discusses our findings.

## Data and Variables

The data provided from Kaggle contains 12 unique features (here we only use 8 of them) and 23463 records of city air quality. The dataset uses integer values to describe items of "AQI Value", while it uses verbal descriptions "Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups", "Unhealthy", "Very Unhealthy" and "Hazardous" to describe items of ”AQI Category”.

```{r tab1}
air = read.csv("global air pollution dataset.csv")
colnames(air) = c("Country","City","AQI","AQI.Cat","CO","CO.Cat","Ozone","Ozone.Cat","NO2","NO2.Cat","PM2.5","PM2.5.Cat")
air$AQI.Cat <- factor(air$AQI.Cat, levels = c("Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups", "Unhealthy", "Very Unhealthy", "Hazardous"), labels = c(1:6))
air <- air[, c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11)]
air1 = air
air1$Country = 0
air1$City = 0
air1$AQI.Cat = 0

tab <- data.frame(
  Mean = round(colMeans(air1), 2),
  SD = round(sapply(air1, sd), 2),
  Min = round(sapply(air1, min), 2),
  Max = round(sapply(air1, max), 2)
)

tab[c(1,2,4),] = " "
tab$Type <- c(
  "Factor",
  "Factor",
  "Continuous",
  "Factor",
  "Continuous",

)
tab$Definition <- c(

  "Overall AQI category of the city",
  "AQI value of Carbon Monoxide of the city",
  "AQI value of Ozone of the city",
  "AQI value of Nitrogen Dioxide of the city",
  "AQI value of Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less"
)
tab <- data.frame(Variable = rownames(tab), tab, row.names = NULL)
tab <- tab[, c(1, 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 5)]
kable(tab,
      caption = "\\label{tab1}Definitions and Summary Statistics of Variables",
      booktabs = T,
      linesep = "") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position", font_size = 8, full_width = T) %>%
  column_spec(3, width = "20em")
```


# Explorative Data Analysis

In this section we focuses on gaining a deeper understanding of the data before building models. We aims to provide insights into the dataset, identify important variables, and understand their relationships.

## AQI Overview

The Average AQI Value World Map, by providing a comprehensive overview of average AQI values, highlights areas that are highly polluted and those with relatively cleaner air. Notably, the map demonstrates that Asia and Africa, in particular, exhibit a concentration of highly polluted regions.

One striking observation is that India emerges as the 9th most polluted country. However, what sets India apart from other highly polluted countries is the largest standard deviation of its AQI, implying an unbalanced air quality conditions within India. Since Korea has only one observation in this data, its highest AQI value is not representative.

```{r fig1, fig.cap="\\label{fig1} Average AQI Value World Map and Rankings",fig.pos="H",out.width="45%",out.height="45%",fig.align='center',fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("Average AQI Value World Map1.png")
knitr::include_graphics("ranking.png")
```

## Factor Insights

Labeling the AQI categories ('Good' to 'Hazardous') from 1 to 6, the Ridgeline Charts of the pollutant AQI values have shown a relatively significant difference in Ozone and PM2.5 AQI values, while the other two need a further test.

    )

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2)
```

To test the differences in means of the other two pollutants, CO and NO2, we opt to use the Tukey's HSD test for conducting the family-wise comparison. The results in Figure \ref{fig3} indicate that, with a 95% family-wise confidence interval, the AQI values within CO are significantly different. However, for two pairs (2-6, 3-4) in NO2, there is not much difference.

```{r fig3,fig.cap="\\label{fig3}Family-wise CI by Tukey’s HSD",fig.width=15,fig.height=4,fig.pos="H",fig.align='center'}
mod1 <- aov(CO ~ 0 + AQI.Cat, data = air)
mod1.Tukey <- TukeyHSD (mod1, conf.level = 0.95)

mod2 <- aov(NO2 ~ 0 + AQI.Cat, data = air)
mod2.Tukey <- TukeyHSD (mod2, conf.level = 0.95)

par(mfrow = c(1,2))

p5 = plot(mod1.Tukey, sub="Tukey's HSD for CO")
p6 = plot(mod2.Tukey, sub="Tukey's HSD for NO2")
```

We can further look into the correlations among the AQI values. The Correlogram shows an overall positive correlations with one exception between Ozone and NO2. It is noticeable that the correlation between overall AQI values and PM2.5 AQI values has reached 0.98. Based on the calculation formula of AQI that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:eqn1}
    OverallAQI = Max\{ Categorical AQI \}
\end{equation}
\noindent where PM10 and SO2 are also pollutants but not included in the dataset, the correlation implies that PM2.5 is supposed to be the main contributor.

```{r fig4,fig.cap="\\label{fig4}Correlogram of AQI Values",fig.width=14,fig.height=3.6,fig.pos="H",fig.align='center'}
library(GGally)
library(corrgram)

ggpairs(air,columns = c("AQI","CO","Ozone","NO2","PM2.5")) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1, axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())
```


# Model Building & Diagnostics

In this section, we delve deeper through models. First, we examine whether the observed values can be grouped well by clustering, and then we consider the fitting relationship between variables by linear regression analysis.

## K-Means Clustering

Firstly, we apply K-Means Clustering to see if the data can be well grouped based on 4 categorical AQIs. In order to eliminate the possible scaling effects of variables, we have standardized the variables here.

By plotting Within cluster Sum of Squares against the number of clusters, it seems that there is no significant elbow point (Left panel of Figure \ref{fig5}). Taking k = 3 as an example, the Silhouette Plot in the upper-right panel shows an average silhouette width of 0.63. But the Silhouette Score Plot in the lower-right panel has shown that the data may not be able to well clustered with k > 2. The above information indicates that the data may not be able to well grouped based on 4 categorical AQIs.

```{r fig5,fig.cap="\\label{fig5}Elbow Plot, Silhouette Plot and Silhouette Score Plot",fig.pos="H",out.width="80%",out.height="80%",fig.align='center',fig.show='hold'}
library(stats)

scaled_data <- scale(air[,c("CO","Ozone","NO2","PM2.5")])

knitr::include_graphics("cluster.png")
```


## Linear Regression Model

As the calculation formula of AQI has fixed (shown in Equation \eqref{eqn:eqn1}), it is meaningless to study the linear relationship between overall AQI and categorical AQI, so we consider the relationship between categorical AQI. Considering that PM2.5 is the primary contributor to the AQI values, we propose building a Linear Regression Model to estimate PM2.5 based on CO, Ozone, and NO2. As PM2.5 is highly right-skewed, we derive a Box-cox Plot to determine the appropriate transformation (As PM2.5 contains value of 0, here we add 1 to all the values). As shown in Figure \ref{fig6}, within the 95% confidence interval, we choose the lambda of 0.1.

```{r fig6,fig.cap="\\label{fig6}Box-cox Plot of Dependent Variable",fig.width=12,fig.height=4,fig.pos="H",fig.align='center'}

library(MASS)

boxcox((PM2.5+1)~Ozone+NO2+CO, data = air, lambda = seq(0.05, 0.15, length = 10))
```

After fitting the model
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:eqn2}
    (PM2.5+1)^{0.1} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Ozone + \beta_2 NO_2 + \beta_3 CO + e
\end{equation}
\noindent we get the estimates all significantly differing from 0 (more precisely, greater than 0), indicating that they are all necessary variables. By plotting the diagnostic plots, we observe significant heteroskedasticity, nonlinear relationship and possible outliers.

```{r tab2}
air$tr_PM2.5 = (air$PM2.5+1)^0.1
reg1 = lm(tr_PM2.5~Ozone+NO2+CO,air)
coef <- summary(reg1)$coefficients
coef <- data.frame(Variable = rownames(coef), coef, row.names = NULL)
colnames(coef) <- c("Variable","Estimate","Std.Err.","t-stat","p-value")
coef[,-1] <- round(coef[,-1],5)
kable(
  coef,
  caption = "\\label{tab2}OLS Regression Results",
  booktabs = T,
  linesep = ""
) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position", font_size = 10)
```

```{r fig7,fig.cap="\\label{fig7}Diagnostic Plots of OLS Regression",fig.width=12,fig.height=6,fig.pos="H",fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(reg1)
```

To address the issue of unequal variance, we attempt to use a Weighted Least Squares (WLS) model. However, the results are not satisfactory (shown in Appendix Figure \ref{figa1}).

Additionally, we examine possible outliers using the Cook's Distance Plot (Appendix Figure \ref{figa2}), revealing that the 5157th and 12801st observations are considered influential due to their exceptionally high CO and Ozone AQI values, respectively.

In an effort to capture any non-linear relationships, we consider including quadratic & interaction terms in the model. We employ Mallow's Cp as the criteria. However, the result indicates that all nine parameters should be included (Appendix Table \ref{taba3}), with a Cp value of 10. Despite fitting the model with these terms, the problem remains unresolved, and the interpretability of the model is significantly reduced.

The above diagnosis reveals unsatisfactory results, which could be attributed to the limitations of the existing data fitting and significant variations in air quality patterns (economy, geography, policy etc.) across different regions worldwide. Therefore, it may be more valuable to study local and national data than to study global AQI data.


# Case Study on India

Therefore, we proceeded with an analysis focused on a single country, as mentioned in the beginning, India, which exhibits interesting phenomena in its air quality patterns. The AQI gradually increases from the south and east towards the northwest.

```{r fig8,fig.cap="\\label{fig8}AQI Values for Different Cities in India",fig.pos="H",out.width="45%",out.height="45%",fig.align='center',fig.show='hold'}

knitr::include_graphics("india.png")
```

This phenomenon is well reflected in regression fitting as well. Here we obtained additional latitude and longitude data for Indian cities and used them as independent variables. As shown in \ref{tab3}, the regression for 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:eqn3}
    Overall AQI = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Latitude + \beta_2 Longitude + e
\end{equation}
\noindent is shown in the left side. And the regression for
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:eqn4}
    PM2.5 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Ozone + \beta_2 NO_2 + \beta_3 CO + e
\end{equation}
\noindent is shown in the right side. From the regression results of this single country, we can see that the AQI index gradually increases as the latitude goes up, and gradually increases as the longitude goes down (moving westward) - which is consistent with the intuitive conclusion we drew from the Figure \ref{fig8} earlier.

```{r tab3}
india = read.csv("india.csv")
reg3 = lm(AQI~Latitude+Longitude,india)
reg4 = lm(PM2.5~Ozone+NO2+CO, india)

coef1 <- summary(reg3)$coefficients
coef1 <- data.frame(Variable = rownames(coef1), coef1, row.names = NULL)
coef1[,-1] <- round(coef1[,-1],5)
coef1[4,] = ""
coef1[,6] = ""
colnames(coef1) <- c("Variable","Estimate","Std.Err.","t-stat","p-value"," ")

coef2 <- summary(reg4)$coefficients
coef2 <- data.frame(Variable = rownames(coef2), coef2, row.names = NULL)
colnames(coef2) <- c("Variable","Estimate","Std.Err.","t-stat","p-value")
coef2[,-1] <- round(coef2[,-1],5)

coef = cbind(coef1,coef2)

kable(
  coef,
  caption = "\\label{tab3}Two OLS Regressions Results",
  booktabs = T,
  linesep = ""
) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position", font_size = 10)
```

In the diagnostic plots of the two regressions, compared with the original OLS regression using the global dataset, there is relatively better satisfaction in terms of linearity, homoscedasticity, normality, and other assumptions.

```{r fig9,fig.cap="\\label{fig9}Diagnostic Plots of Two OLS Regressions",fig.width=12,fig.height=6,fig.pos="H",fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow = c(2,4))
plot(reg3)
plot(reg4)
```

One possible explanation for this pattern is the influence of the monsoon season in India. As the Figure \ref{fig10} shows, the direction of the increase in AQI in India is highly consistent with the direction of the monsoon. Studies have also shown a high correlation between the Indian monsoon and air pollution (Lau et al. 2009).

```{r fig10,fig.cap="\\label{fig10}AQI Values and Monsoon Trends Comparison*",fig.pos="H",out.width="40%",out.height="40%",fig.align='center',fig.show='hold'}

knitr::include_graphics("india.png")
knitr::include_graphics("monsoon.png")
```






# Conclusion and Discussion

In the analysis of AQI data, we explored various aspects related to pollution. We overview the data in a geographic aspect, finding that Asia and Africa exhibit a concentration of highly polluted regions. We examined different pollutants, with a particular focus on PM2.5 as the primary contributor to AQI values. We attempted to cluster and build regression models to understand the relationships between pollutants, where we encountered challenges which posed difficulties in achieving optimal results. And this could be attributed to the limitations of the existing data fitting and significant variations in air quality patterns across different regions worldwide.

However, with focusing on a single country, the problems seem to be better solved. In our example of India, the AQI values are highly possibly correlated with the monsoon season in India.

The importance of transitioning from a reactive approach to a proactive stance in safeguarding air quality has always been paramount. Through further analysis using more detailed data, for example, predictive analysis with time-series data and causal analysis with more diverse data such as economics, policy, geography，we can enhance our understanding of the issue and pave the way for comprehensive protection measures to be implemented.
